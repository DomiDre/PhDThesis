# Abbreviations used:
# B -- applied magnetic field
# M -- magnetization of sample
# V -- volume of magnetic sample

# Parameters for VSM sample evaluation
B_column	Applied Field		#  which column shall be loaded for B
M_column	Raw Signal Mx   	#  which column shall be loaded for M
B_unit		T			#  convert to which magnetic field unit, can choose between: T, mT, Oe
M_unit		memu			#  convert to which magnetization unit, can choose between: Am2, memu, emu, Am-1, kAm-1
noise_level	5e-3			#  noise level of VSM in memu
V		Not set			#  in mm3 (ÂµL), needed if M_unit is A/m, kA/m, volume of measured magnetic material

# tell where to load data from and where to save the xy columns to
# if multiple pairs are given, multiple files are created
