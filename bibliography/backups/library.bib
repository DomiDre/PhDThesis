abstract = {The ability to assemble nanoscopic components into larger structures and materials depends crucially on the ability to understand in quantitative detail and subsequently "engineer" the interparticle interactions. This Review provides a critical examination of the various interparticle forces (van der Waals, electrostatic, magnetic, molecular, and entropic) that can be used in nanoscale self-assembly. For each type of interaction, the magnitude and the length scale are discussed, as well as the scaling with particle size and interparticle distance. In all cases, the discussion emphasizes characteristics unique to the nanoscale. These theoretical considerations are accompanied by examples of recent experimental systems, in which specific interaction types were used to drive nanoscopic self-assembly. Overall, this Review aims to provide a comprehensive yet easily accessible resource of nanoscale-specific interparticle forces that can be implemented in models or simulations of self-assembly processes at this scale.},

abstract = {This perspective article will give an overview of recent experimental results related to the realization and use of anisotropic magnetic colloids, i.e. microscopic particles having the shape, composition or structured surface which set a preferred magnetization direction. The possibility of remotely controlling these soft matter building blocks via external fields makes them ideal for a wide range of applications, from their use as active microrheological probes to infer the viscoelastic properties of complex fluids to their implementation as active systems in microfluidic devices. This article will also review the recent use of these anisotropic units as field driven or guided propellers, which can be magnetically moved or guided in a fluid medium, thus being potentially useful in precise single-particle drug delivery operations.},

abstract = {Oriented attachment of synthetic semiconductor nanocrystals is emerging as a route for obtaining new semiconductors that can have Dirac-type electronic bands such as graphene, but also strong spin-orbit coupling. The two-dimensional (2D) assembly geometry will require both atomic coherence and long-range periodicity of the superlattices. We show how the interfacial self-assembly and oriented attachment of nanocrystals results in 2D metal chalcogenide semiconductors with a honeycomb superlattice. We present an extensive atomic and nanoscale characterization of these systems using direct imaging and wave scattering methods. The honeycomb superlattices are atomically coherent and have an octahedral symmetry that is buckled; the nanocrystals occupy two parallel planes. Considerable necking and large-scale atomic motion occurred during the attachment process.},

@article{Yunker2011,
abstract = {When a drop of liquid dries on a solid surface, its suspended particulate matter is deposited in ring-like fashion. This phenomenon, known as the coffee-ring effect, is familiar to anyone who has observed a drop of coffee dry. During the drying process, drop edges become pinned to the substrate, and capillary flow outward from the centre of the drop brings suspended particles to the edge as evaporation proceeds. After evaporation, suspended particles are left highly concentrated along the original drop edge. The coffee-ring effect is manifested in systems with diverse constituents, ranging from large colloids to nanoparticles and individual molecules. In fact--despite the many practical applications for uniform coatings in printing, biology and complex assembly-the ubiquitous nature of the effect has made it difficult to avoid. Here we show experimentally that the shape of the suspended particles is important and can be used to eliminate the coffee-ring effect: ellipsoidal particles are deposited uniformly during evaporation. The anisotropic shape of the particles significantly deforms interfaces, producing strong interparticle capillary interactions. Thus, after the ellipsoids are carried to the air-water interface by the same outward flow that causes the coffee-ring effect for spheres, strong long-ranged interparticle attractions between ellipsoids lead to the formation of loosely packed or arrested structures on the air-water interface. These structures prevent the suspended particles from reaching the drop edge and ensure uniform deposition. Interestingly, under appropriate conditions, suspensions of spheres mixed with a small number of ellipsoids also produce uniform deposition. Thus, particle shape provides a convenient parameter to control the deposition of particles, without modification of particle or solvent chemistry.},

abstract = {A macroscopic evaporating water droplet with suspended particles on a solid surface will form a ring-like structure at the pinned contact line due to induced capillary flow. As the droplet size shrinks, the competition between the time scales of the liquid evaporation and the particle movement may influence the resulting ring formation. When the liquid evaporates much faster than the particle movement, coffee ring formation may cease. Here, we experimentally show that there exists a lower limit of droplet size, D(c), for the successful formation of a coffee ring structure. When the particle concentration is above a threshold value, D(c) can be estimated by considering the collective effects of the liquid evaporation and the particle diffusive motion within the droplet. For suspended particles of size approximately 100 nm, the minimum diameter of the coffee ring structure is found to be approximately 10 microm.},

@article{Routh2013,
abstract = {When thin films of colloidal fluids are dried, a range of transitions are observed and the final film profile is found to depend on the processes that occur during the drying step. This article describes the drying process, initially concentrating on the various transitions. Particles are seen to initially consolidate at the edge of a drying droplet, the so-called coffee-ring effect. Flow is seen to be from the centre of the drop towards the edge and a front of close-packed particles passes horizontally across the film. Just behind the particle front the now solid film often displays cracks and finally the film is observed to de-wet. These various transitions are explained, with particular reference to the capillary pressure which forms in the solidified region of the film. The reasons for cracking in thin films is explored as well as various methods to minimize its effect. Methods to obtain stratified coatings through a single application are considered for a one-dimensional drying problem and this is then extended to two-dimensional films. Different evaporative models are described, including the physical reason for enhanced evaporation at the edge of droplets. The various scenarios when evaporation is found to be uniform across a drying film are then explained. Finally different experimental techniques for examining the drying step are mentioned and the article ends with suggested areas that warrant further study.},

abstract = {Comprehensive knowledge over the shape of nanomaterials is a critical factor in designing devices with desired functions. Due to this reason, systematic efforts have been made to synthesize materials of diverse shape in the nanoscale regime. Anisotropic nanomaterials are a class of materials in which their properties are direction-dependent and more than one structural parameter is needed to describe them. Their unique and fine-tuned physical and chemical properties make them ideal candidates for devising new applications. In addition, the assembly of ordered one-dimensional (1D), two-dimensional (2D), and three-dimensional (3D) arrays of anisotropic nanoparticles brings novel properties into the resulting system, which would be entirely different from the properties of individual nanoparticles. This review presents an overview of current research in the area of anisotropic nanomaterials in general and noble metal nanoparticles in particular. We begin with an introduction to the advancements in this area followed by general aspects of the growth of anisotropic nanoparticles. Then we describe several important synthetic protocols for making anisotropic nanomaterials, followed by a summary of their assemblies, and conclude with major applications.},

Depending on the interactions between the colloidal particles, colloidal structures can be affected dramatically and modulated by applying an additional external field. Furthermore, in contrast to other approaches, self-assembled nanostructures with large areas or designed shapes can be prepared at low cost. As a result, the use of such colloidal systems has been investigated in many practical photonic applications. In this review article, we describe the colloidal self-assembly of periodic and non-periodic photonic nanostructures in brief and then summarize recent achievements in the field of colloidal photonic nanostructures and their applications, which include displays, optical devices, photochemistry and biological sensors.},

With a minute amount of a polystyrene colloidal suspension and without any special equipment, the proposed method can be used to rapidly deposit high-quality colloidal crystal films over a large surface area. By controlling the lift-up rate of the substrate, we modulate the meniscus thinning rate, which determines whether the colloidal particles are assembled into two or three dimensions. The proposed method can be used to fabricate not only monolayered colloidal crystals with colloidal particles of various sizes, but also multilayered colloidal crystals. In addition, the method enables us to fabricate binary colloidal crystals by consecutively depositing large and small particles.},

A coplanar electrode configuration, with 1 to 2 mm electrode gaps (20-50 V ac, 0.5-5.0 kHz) was used, and the experiments were monitored with fluorescence microscopy. For all particle suspensions, the field brought about significant changes in the packing and orientation. Extensive particle chaining and packing were observed for the disk, rod, and hexnut suspensions. Because of the size and geometry of the boomerang particles, limited chaining was observed; however, the field triggered a change from random to a more ordered packing arrangement.},

abstract = {Colloidal dispersions of Ni nanorods were synthesized by pulsed electrodeposition of Ni into nanoporous aluminum oxide layers followed by dissolution of the templates. Geometrical characterization of the nanorods by transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy allowed us to determine the average length (100-250 nm) and diameter (20-40 nm) of the rods and to estimate the thickness of the polyvinylpyrrolidone surfactant layer. Due to their acicular shape, nanorods of the given size are uniaxial ferromagnetic single domain particles and exhibit a distinct anisotropic polarizability. These two characteristic properties are the physical basis for magnetic field-dependent optical transmission and allow us to investigate the rotational diffusion of the nanorods in liquid dispersion. In the present study, we employed AC magnetization measurements, dynamical light scattering and optical transmission measurements in a rotating magnetic field to determine the rotational diffusion coefficient. The results from all three methods were consistent and agree with theory within a factor of 2.},

abstract = {Within the field of nanotechnology, nanoparticles are one of the most prominent and promising candidates for technological applications. Self-assembly of nanoparticles has been identified as an important process where the building blocks spontaneously organize into ordered structures by thermodynamic and other constraints. However, in order to successfully exploit nanoparticle self-assembly in technological applications and to ensure efficient scale-up, a high level of direction and control is required. The present review critically investigates to what extent self-assembly can be directed, enhanced, or controlled by either changing the energy or entropy landscapes, using templates or applying external fields.},

These new particles are poised to become the 'atoms' and 'molecules' of tomorrow's materials if they can be successfully assembled into useful structures. Here, we discuss the recent progress made in the synthesis of nanocrystals and colloidal particles and draw analogies between these new particulate building blocks and better-studied molecules and supramolecular objects. We argue for a conceptual framework for these new building blocks based on anisotropy attributes and discuss the prognosis for future progress in exploiting anisotropy for materials design and assembly.},

abstract = {Uniform cylindrical rods of copper succinate dihydrate of several microns in length and 200 nm in diameter were obtained by the reverse micellar (microemulsion) method at room temperature using CTAB as the surfactant. The rod-like structures are formed by an ordered assembly of spherical particles of 4-5 nm, which is facilitated by water molecules. The copper succinate particles, in the absence of the microemulsion or surfactant, show only spherical geometry, while in the presence of the surfactant, thicker rods (compared to as obtained by reverse micellar method) of varying length were obtained. The formation of the rod-like structure is driven by the permanent dipole moment of the succinate ion, which leads to the oriented attachment of the nanoparticles in the presence of the surfactant. A new phase (anhydrous copper succinate) is obtained upon heating the dihydrate at 75 degrees C, which shows branched and corrugated rods assembled from a random arrangement of nanoparticles. The water molecules appear to control the morphology of the rods giving smooth rods (ordered arrangement of nanoparticles) for the dihydrate while branched or disrupted rods with random arrangement of nanoparticles are obtained for the anhydrous phase. The chain length of the dicarboxylic acid (ligand) appears to have a role in controlling the aspect ratio of these anisotropic mesostructures. The ability to generate suitable conditions for self assembly into ordered nanostructures and to control the anisotropy would lead us towards a proper design of nanodevices.},

We have investigated how the degree of truncation of iron oxide nanocubes controls the mesostructure and particle orientation in drop cast mesocrystal arrays. The combination of grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering and scanning electron microscopy shows that mesocrystals of highly truncated cubic nanoparticles assemble in an fcc-type mesostructure, similar to arrays formed by iron oxide nanospheres, but with a significantly reduced packing density and displaying two different growth orientations. Strong satellite reflections in the GISAXS pattern indicate a commensurate mesoscopic superstructure that is related to stacking faults in mesocrystals of the anisotropic nanocubes. Our results show how subtle variation in shape anisotropy can induce oriented arrangements of nanoparticles of different structures and also create mesoscopic superstructures of larger periodicity.},

In situ grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) measurements with 20 ms time resolution allow a real-time observation of the emergence and evolution of the microstructure during a spray cycle and subsequent solvent evaporation. The results reveal multistage nanoscale ordering of the Au nanoparticles during the spray cycle. Further ex situ atomic force microscopy measurements of the sprayed films showed the formation of Au monolayer islands on top of the polymer film. Our study suggests that the solvent-substrate interaction as well as solvent evaporation kinetics are important factors that need to be taken into consideration in order to grow a compact uniform monolayer film for the fabrication of ultrathin films using airbrush deposition.},

abstract = {The hydrothermal growth mechanism of $\alpha$-Fe₂O₃ nanorods has been investigated using a novel valve assisted pressure autoclave. This approach has facilitated the rapid quenching of hydrothermal suspensions into liquid nitrogen, providing 'snapshots' representative of the near in situ physical state of the synthesis reaction products as a function of known temperature. Examination of the acquired samples using complementary characterisation techniques of transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) has provided fundamental insight into the anisotropic crystal growth mechanism of the lenticular $\alpha$-Fe₂O₃ nanorods.An intermediate {\ss}-FeOOH phase was observed to precipitate alongside small primary $\alpha$-Fe₂O₃ nanoparticles. Dissolution of the {\ss}-FeOOH phase with increasing temperature, in accordance with Ostwald's rule of stages, led to the release of Fe³+ anions back into solution to supply the growth of $\alpha$-Fe₂O₃ nanoparticles, which in turn coalesced to form lenticular $\alpha$-Fe₂O₃ nanorods. The critical role of the PO₄³⁻ surfactant on mediating the lenticular shape of the $\alpha$-Fe₂O₃ nanorods is emphasised. Strong phosphate anion absorption on $\alpha$-Fe₂O₃ crystal surfaces stabilised the primary $\alpha$-Fe₂O₃ nanoparticle size to {\textless} 10 nm. FT-IR investigation of the quenched reaction products provided evidence for PO₄³⁻ absorption on the $\alpha$-Fe₂O₃ nanoparticles in the form of mono or bi-dentate (bridging) surface complexes on surfaces normal and parallel to the crystallographic $\alpha$-Fe₂O₃ c-axis, respectively. Monodentate PO₄³⁻ absorption is considered weaker and hence easily displaced during growth, as compared to absorbed PO₄³⁻ bi-dentate species, which implies the $\alpha$-Fe₂O₃ c-planes are favoured for the oriented attachment of primary $\alpha$-Fe₂O₃ nanoparticles, resulting in the development of filamentary features which act as the basis of growth, defining the shape of the lenticular $\alpha$-Fe₂O₃ nanorods.},
