  Using polarized neutron reflectometry, the magnetic profile of the double layers is studied with depth resolution.
  With the result of the monolayer fit in \refsec{sec:monolayers:structure:verticalModel}, the expected reflectivity for $R^{+}$ and $R^{-}$ is simulated in \reffig{fig:doubleLayers:pnrSimulation} to discuss the basic differences that should be expected to be observable from the experiment.
  If the two layers are magnetized in parallel, as should be expected at a saturating magnetic field, a homogeneous splitting of the two channels is observed, where a clear separation between the maxima in $R^{+}$ and $R^{-}$ is visible.
  For the case, where the two layers are aligned anti-parallel, the splitting reduces and in the either case of a small or large PMMA gap, the maxima in the Kiessig fringes are touching one another and the splitting is only found in between.
  For the larger PMMA thickness sample, the splitting is visible from the critical edge up to the correlation peak around $0.9 \unit{nm^{-1}}$ that corresponds to the length scale of the single layers in the equally aligned case.
  Whereas for the anti-parallel aligned case, around the critical edge and the correlation peak, both channels overlap and only a splitting in the intermediate $q$ - range of the Kiessig fringes is visible.
  Close inspection also shows that the splitting might inverse as the simulations shows for the larger gap sample with $R^{-} > R^{+}$.
  This is dependent on whether it is chosen that the upper layer is anti-parallel to the beam polarization or whether the lower layer is, as the other choice results in the same reflectivities but with $R^{+} > R^{-}$, shown exemplary in the sample with low PMMA thickness.

  Using the discussed model, the reflectivity of the double layers shown in \reffig{fig:doubleLayers:pnrData} are analyzed.
  In all cases a homogeneous splitting is observed at $6 \unit{T}$, with a clear separation of $R^{+}$ and $R^{-}$ as it would be expected for a homogeneously magnetized sample.
  For the study of the ground state and dipolar interaction, the interesting cases are the measurements directly after zero-field cooling and in remanence after application of a saturating field.
  The samples DL-0.25\%, DL-1.25\% and DL-2.5\% show that initially after zero-field cooling no strong splitting is visible.
  Slight differences in $R^{+}$ and $R^{-}$ are however visible in both DL-1.25\% and DL-2.5\%.
  The observations are telling that macroscopically the sample is in a magnetically disordered state with no preference of the in-plane magnetization in direction of the applied field versus the direction anti-parallel to it.
  In the remanent state, a clear separation of the two states at the peaks of the Kiessig fringes is visible.
  Using the result of the previously discussed simulation, this observation can be used to exclude an antiferromagnetic alignment in each case.
  This is in agreement with the macroscopic magnetization measurement in \refsec{sec:doubleLayers:vsm}, where an anti-parallel alignment of the layers at low fields would otherwise become visible by a strong decrease in the magnetization magnitude instead of the observed wide hysteresis in each case.

  What however can not be excluded from the qualitative discussion of the data is an only partially anti-parallel alignment of the layers due to interlayer dipolar coupling combined with a partially ferromagnetic alignment.
  To discuss this, a detailed quantitative evaluation by scattering length density profile models is necessary, which is however outside the scope of this present work.
