    The D33 instrument \cite{Dewhurst_2015_Thesm} at the Institut Laue-Langevin is used to measure small-angle scattering of polarised neutrons for dispersions, as well as for samples on a substrate under grazing-incidence.
    Similar to D17 \ref{ch:lss:d17} it can be used in monochromatic and TOF mode, where in this thesis the monochromatic mode is chosen for all measurements.
    The Astrium EADS velocity selector can be used to select a wavelength in the range of $4.5 \ldots 40 \unit{\angstrom}$ with a energy resolution of $10 \unit{\%}$ (FWHM).
    It has an adjustable collimation-to-sample and sample-to-detector distance, which can be chosen incrementally in the range $L_\mathrm{CSD} \eq 2.8 \ldots 12.8 \unit{m}$ and $L_\mathrm{SSD} \eq 1.2 \ldots 12.8 \unit{m}$ respectively.
    The collimation is chosen analogue to D22 by the aid of four $2.5 \unit{m}$ changer sections, which can either be a neutron guide of an empty flight path with an absorbing boron carbide lined tube and antiparasitic baffles.
    The angular divergence can thereby be defined between $0.01^\circ \ldots 0.31^\circ$, depending on the chosen lengths and apertures.

    The neutron polarisation is obtained by the insertion of a \ch{Fe}/\ch{Si} multilayer mirror close to the velocity selector between the chopper system of D33 with a single-blade mirror for long wavelengths and a V-shaped mirror for short wavelengths.
    The RF flipper is installed close to the polarizer 
    The polarization efficiency of this mirror system is in the order of $>95 \unit{\%}$, where the flipping efficiency is $>99 \unit{\%}$.

    The data reduction including the correction for polarization efficiency, as well as detector sensitiviy can be performed using the Matlab script GRASP \cite{Dewhurst_2003_Grasp}.
