  \label{sec:monolayers:nanoparticle:dropcastingExperiments}

  In the following, the steps in every drop-casting experiment are described, as well as the preparation conditions are given for the presented samples in this chapter.

  \paragraphNewLine{Preparation of the silicon substrate}
    Single-crystalline silicon substrates with (100) orientation were purchased from Crystec GmbH with a thickness of $0.525 \unit{mm}$ and precutted to $10 \times 10 \unit{mm^2}$ squares.
    The wafers are polished on one side, which is used as surface for the drop-casting experiments.
    To remove the protective film from the polished side, the substrates are cleaned using an Elmasonic P60 ultrasonic bath, where the wafer is first submerged in acetone for 10 minutes and subsequently cleaned in 2-propanol of HPLC grade.
