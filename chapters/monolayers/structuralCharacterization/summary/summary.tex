  In summary, the reflectometry data of both X-ray and neutron reflectometry can be fit by the same model of an homogeneous thin layer structure, thus approving the monolayer property on a large scale.
  The roughness parameters are reasonably small and in case of the nanocube/OA interface comparable to the size distribution of the edge length.
  The determined packing density speaks for a densely packed structure.
  To further quantify the long-ranged in-plane order, grazing-incidence small-angle scattering experiments are discussed and simulated in the following.
