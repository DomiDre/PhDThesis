  To understand whether effects of magnetic interparticle interactions emerge from the structure, the expected magnetic structure of long range ordered nanoparticles in the plane is discussed in the following and selected sample characterizations via vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) and polarized grazing incidence small angle neutron scattering (polGISANS) are presented.
  The results are compared to the single particle properties obtained from the nanoparticle in dispersion, as well as to the theory to deduce upon emergent properties.
