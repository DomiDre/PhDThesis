  The field-dependent magnetization of ML-Ac-CoFe-C and ML-Ac-CoFe-C-2 is shown in \reffig{fig:monolayer:magneticStructure:MLAcCoFeC} and \reffig{fig:monolayer:magneticStructure:MLAcCoFeC2} respectively.

  % After drop casting cubic nanoparticles in a ordered square lattice, the measured low-temperature hysteresis loop changes drastically from the behaviour observed for the unordered case obtained from measuring a frozen dispersion.
  % As can be seen in \reffig{fig:monolayer:magneticStructure:ppms} (left), the hysteresis loop shows a strong jump around zero field, which is not visible in the measurement of the same nanoparticles that were frozen in dispersion in \reffig{fig:monolayers:nanoparticle:vsm10K} (right).
  % The effect is visible up to a temperature of $150 \unit{K}$ as can be seen in \reffig{fig:monolayer:magneticStructure:ppmsMultiT}.

Analogue to \reffig{fig:monolayer:magneticStructure:MLAcCoFeC}, the $300 \unit{K}$ magnetization behaviour of Ac-CoFe-C-2 is added as guide in the left plot.}
