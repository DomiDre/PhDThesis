  In conclusion, the self-consistent agreement between the GISAXS, XRR and SAXS data and the produced model prove that the sample can macroscopically be described by a simple monolayer with paracrystalline long-range order.
  Adding now that the nanocubes are additionally magnetic macrospins, the presented preparation method produces an ideal model system to study dipolar interaction on an ordered two dimensional nanostructure.
