  The evaluation of the spectra obtained by EDX on large agglomerations of the nanoparticle batches yields the relative compositon in iron and cobalt for the nanoparticle batches as tabulated in \reftab{tab:monolayers:nanoparticles:edx}.
  Ol-CoFe-C has a composition ratio $2.49(27)$, for a feed ratio of $2$.
  Ac-CoFe-C shows a ratio of iron to cobalt of $3.35(10)$, whereas Ac-Co-Fe-C-2 is given by $2.67(6)$.
  This can be compared to the feed ratio of $1.54$ used in Ac-CoFe-C and $1.74$ in Ac-CoFe-C-2.
  This is in contrast to the linear dependence of feed ratio and resulting composition ratio that is observed in literature \cite{Sathya_2016_Cofeo}.

  To explain this discrepancy, the differently chosen heating rates in both synthesis need to be considered.
  The reactants in the acetylacetonates synthesis decompose not exactly equally as can be seen by a thermogravimetric-analysis performed on the chemicals as shown in \reffig{fig:monolayers:nanoparticle:edx:TGARefluxAcAc}.
  The iron acetylacetonate decomposes faster in comparison and therefore, when given more time by a slow heating as was the case in the synthesis of Ac-CoFe-C ($5 \unit{K \, min^{-1}}$) in comparison to Ac-CoFe-C-2  ($15 \unit{K \, min^{-1}}$), the ratio of iron to cobalt monomers is in favor of iron at the growth stage.

  The ratio can be used to deduce the formula unit of the nanoparticles from acetylacetonate.
  The result for both assumptions, a complete occupation of the inverse spinell structure, as typically assumed in literature, and a partially vacant crystal structure with only \ch{Fe^{3+}} are listed in \reftab{tab:monolayers:nanoparticles:edx}.
  For the cases given, the effect of the choice has a small impact on the resulting formula unit.
  For the continuing analysis of the nanoparticles, it is taken that the second formula unit as it is believed that no \ch{Fe^{2+}} is present.
  Thus Ac-CoFe-C has the average formula unit \ch{Co_{0.66} Fe_{2.22} O4} and Ac-CoFe-C-2 \ch{Co_{0.80} Fe_{2.13} O4}.

  For Ol-CoFe-C, the information of the ratio of cobalt to iron in the nanoparticle is not enough to deduce on the formula unit. Here, the core-shell nanoparticles have two phases that may contain cobalt and iron, namely \ch{Co_x Fe_{3-x} O4} and \ch{Fe_y Co_{1-y} O}
  % As XRD in \refsec{sec:monolayers:nanoparticle:xrd} however suggests that $97 \%$ of the nanoparticle volume is in a wustite phase, the ratio can be used to approximate the relative composition of iron and cobalt in the w\"ustite phase.
  % Thereby the core of Ol-CoFe-C has the composition \ch{Fe_{0.71} Co_{0.29} O}.
  % The shell composition could only be given with a large error margin due to the low volume fraction, therefore it is assumed to be \ch{CoFe2O4} for simplicity.

  The density of the particles is then estimated using the determined composition and the lattice constant from XRD \refsec{sec:monolayers:nanoparticle:xrd}.
