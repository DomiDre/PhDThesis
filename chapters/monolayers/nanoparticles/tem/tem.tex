  \label{sec:monolayers:nanoparticle:tem}
  The exemplary TEM micrographs in \reffig{fig:monolayers:nanoparticle:tem} show in all three cases nanoparticles with a cubic shape.
  Ol-CoFe-C have an average edge length of $10.90(4) \unit{nm}$ and present the lowest size distribution with $8.8(3) \unit{\%}$.
  Inspecting the nanocubes of Ol-CoFe-C more closely in the micrograph shows for many cubes a round dark core area within the cube.
  For the nanocubes prepared by acetylacetonates such phenomenon is not observed.
  Within Ac-CoFe-C, the size distribution is evaluated to a larger value of $13.9(9) \unit{\%}$ and non-cubic particles can be found among the cubes.
  Their average edge length is estimated to $10.1(1) \unit{nm}$ by the log-normal distribution fit.
  Ac-CoFe-C-2 has an intermediate size distribution of $9.9(8) \%$ and an average edge length of $10.8(1) \unit{nm}$.
  Here, the micrographs reveal additionally to the cubes larger non-cubic particles with an approximate extend of $15 \ldots 20 \unit{nm}$ in between the cubes.
  The values evaluated from TEM are summarized in \reftab{tab:monolayers:nanoparticles:discussion:tem}.

  All three nanoparticle batches are in the same order of magnitude of $10 \unit{nm}$.
  In direct comparison of the TEM micrographs, the particles synthesized from cobalt/iron oleates (Ol-CoFe-C) are qualitatively the most homogeneous in shape.
  The oleate synthesis can therefore be considered as the better route in contrast to the synthesis from acetylacetonates  if only a homogeneous shape and small size distribution for the nanoparticles is the criterion.
  The darker core area for Ol-CoFe-C is in agreement with the literature reports of a core-shell structure for nanocubes prepared from metal oleates in 1-octadecene \cite{Bao_2009_Forma, Bodnarchuk_2009_Excha, Wetterskog_2013_Anoma}.

  The results from TEM are a good reference point for the discussion of the furt
