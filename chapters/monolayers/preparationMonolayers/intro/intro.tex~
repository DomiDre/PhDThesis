  % Long-range ordered monolayers can be prepared via drop casting a nanocube dispersion on a flat wafer.
  % Drop-casting is a material efficient and cheap method to prepare thin films.
  % However, experience shows that the homogeneity of such samples suffers due to wetting effects during evaporation.
  % A general approach to improve the quality achieved by drop casting is the usage of co-solvents.
  % Therefore, a method to prepare monolayers of oleic acid coated nanoparticles of approx. $10 - 20 \unit{nm}$ size by drop casting with co-solvents is discussed in the following.
  % The basic idea is to use a mixture of a fast-evaporating solvent, such as n-heptane, as primary dispersion medium and a slow-evaporating solvent, such as 1-octadecene, as addend.
  % After complete evaporation of the fast-evaporating component, a gentle heating step is performed to remove the remaining dispersion medium.
  % The various parameters during drop casting are discussed and optimal value estimation are presented to achieve high-quality monolayers with long range order.
