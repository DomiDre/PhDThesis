  In conclusion, the best quality samples from a series of alkane/alkene combinations is achieved for a combination of \textit{n}-heptane together with an addend of octadecene.
  An approach to explain this specific combination can be given by the freezing point of octadecene and the evaporative cooling properties of \textit{n}-heptane.
  1-octadecene freezes at a temperature of approx. $15 \unit{^\circ C}$, whereas evaporating \textit{n}-heptane and lower order alkanes can cool a surface by over $\Delta T \eq 10 \unit{^\circ C}$ due to evaporative cooling \cite{Tuckermann_2002_Evapo}.
  During evaporation of the quickly evaporating \textit{n}-heptane at room temperature ($T \eq 22 \unit{^\circ C}$ measured for the laboratory surfaces), the surface of the droplet is evaporatively cooled near the freezing temperature of 1-octadecene, which increases the viscosity of the liquid at the surface.
  This generates the condition needed for monolayer formation as described in \cite{Bigioni_2006_Kinet}, where particles are pinned to the surface of the evaporating droplet at which they can find one another to form a single ordered layer.
  Increasing the order of the alkane reduces the evaporative cooling effect from the drop casting experiment, but also increases the time the particles have to order themselves on the droplet surface, where the latter appears to dominate.
  On the other hand, exchanging octadecene for a lower order alkene reduces the freezing point, as to which no long-range order is observed.

  In summary, the presented data show that a combination of \textit{n}-heptane, 1-octadecene and oleic acid, with fine-tuned ratios, lead to long-range order for oleic acid capped nanoparticles into two dimensional structures that depend on the particle shape.
  It is however important that more parameters are considered during and after the two drying stages to obtain clean and homogeneous monolayers, as is discussed in the following.
