\chapter{Structure of \ch{CoFe2O4} Nanocubes}\label{app:structureCoFe2O4Nanocubes}
  To understand the chemical composition and the shape of nanocubes synthesized following the acetylacetonate route described in \refsec{sec:monolayers:nanoparticle:synthesisOleatesAcAc} in more detail, a study on three batches of nanoparticles synthesized with varied cobalt content is presented in the following.
