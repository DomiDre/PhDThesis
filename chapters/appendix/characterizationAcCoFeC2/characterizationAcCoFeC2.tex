\chapter{Characterization of Ac-CoFe-C-2}\label{app:characterizationAcCoFeC2}
  In \refsec{sec:monolayers:nanoparticle:structuralCharacterization}, nanocubes from acetylacetonates are extensively discussed and characterized by TEM, SAXS, SANS(POL), XRD and VSM.
  Due to the small yield of nanocubes it was necessary during this work to prepare a second batch, which is used in \refch{ch:monolayers} to discuss the lateral nuclear and magnetic structure of monolayers by grazing-incidence small-angle scattering, where the preparation has been to most part parallel to Ac-CoFe-C.
  To obtain insight into the single-particle properties, all characterization experiments have also been performed for Ac-CoFe-C2 and are presented here in the following.
