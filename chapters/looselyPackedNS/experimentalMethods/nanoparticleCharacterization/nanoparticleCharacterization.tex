  \paragraphNewLine{Transmission Electron Microscopy}
    Micrographs from transmission electron microscopy were obtained by the collaboration from the University of Mainz that prepared the nanoparticles.
    The micrographs were measured on a FEI Tecnai T-12-TEM with \ch{LaB6} cathode at an acceleration voltage of $120 \unit{kV}$.
    The nanosphere diameter and size distribution of over 200 nanoparticles was measured manually using the Fiji distribution \cite{Schindelin_2012_Fijia} and evaluated by fitting a log-normal distribution as described in \refsec{ch:methods:em}.

    Due to the occurrence of a large asymmetric size distribution in one batch, it is necessary to fit a bimodal log-normal distribution to properly describe the observed probability distribution.
    The bimodal distribution is defined by
    \begin{align}
      p_\mathrm{bimodal}(d) \eq (1 - \alpha) p_1(d; \mu_1, \sigma_1) + \alpha p_2(d; \mu_2, \sigma_2),
    \end{align}
    where $\alpha$ is the fraction of particles in the second mode and $p_i(d; \mu_i, \sigma_i)$ the log-normal size distribution of mode $i$ with parameters $\mu_i$ and $\sigma_i$ ($i \eq 1,\,2$).

  \paragraphNewLine{X-Ray Diffraction}
    X-ray diffraction of IOS-11 was measured in cooperation with the group of Daniel Nižňanský from the Department of Inorganic Chemistry at the Charles University in Prague on an PANanalytical X'Pert PRO, which is described in \refsec{ch:instruments:laboratoryInstruments:xrd}.
    The sample was evaporated on a glass substrate for the measurement.
    The experiment was performed with a Cu-K$\alpha$ source ($\lambda \eq 1.54 \angstrom$) and a $2 \theta \eq 5^\circ - 80^\circ$ has been measured.
    The instrumental broadening is determined from a \ch{LaB6} reference measurement (SR 660b, NIST).

    To evaluate the data, a LeBail fit is performed using the FullProf suite \cite{Rodriguez_1993_Recen} as described in \refsec{ch:methods:xrd}.
    The background was estimated manually by selecting around 20 background points, from which the measured range is linearly interpolated.
    Due to a large background coming from the glass substrate at low angles, the data between $5 ^\circ - 15 ^\circ$ is excluded from the refinement.
    As it is shown that the inverse spinell phase (space group $Fd\bar{3}m$, No. 227) of magnetite/maghemite is not sufficient to describe the XRD, a combination of an inverse spinell phase and a w\"ustite phase (space group $Fm\bar{3}m$, No. 225) is refined.

  \paragraphNewLine{Small-Angle Scattering}
    Dispersions of IOS-11 and IOS-7 were measured using SAXS at GALAXI (\refsec{ch:lss:galaxi}) and SANS(POL) at D33 (\refsec{ch:lss:d33}) to determine the electronic, nuclear and magnetic structure of the nanospheres.

    For the SAXS measurement, the dispersions are filled in borosilicate capillaries (Hilgenberg GmbH) with $1.5 \unit{mm}$ diameter and a $0.01 \unit{mm}$ wall thickness.
    The capillaries are sealed vacuum-tight on top with a plastic stopper and a liquid glue that cures under UV light (Norland Optical Adhesive).
    Both samples are dispersed in cyclohexane for the measurement, where concentrations in the order of $10 \unit{mg \, mL^{-1}}$ were prepared.
    The samples are measured on the largest ($3.53 \unit{m}$) and shortest ($0.83 \unit{m}$) sample-to-detector distances possible at GALAXI at the Ga-K$\alpha$ wavelength of $\lambda \eq 1.3414 \angstrom$.
    Additionally, a capillary filled with cyclohexane and an empty capillary are measured under the same conditions for subtraction of the background.
    The SAXS data is scaled to absolute units according to the procedure described in \refsec{ch:methods:saxs}.

    For the SANS and SANSPOL measurement on the D33 instrument, $500 \unit{\musf L}$ of IOS-11 and $250 \unit{\musf L}$ of the IOS-7 stock solutions are dried over night at ambient conditions, and then redispersed in $1 \unit{mL}$ toluene-\textit{d8} by sonification.
    The dispersions are measured in Hellma quartz cuvettes with a thickness of $2 \unit{mm}$.
    The wavelength at D33 was set to $6 \unit{\angstrom}$, where the selector provides a wavelength spread of $10 \%$ (FWHM).
    A sample aperture  of $7 \times 10 \unit{mm^2}$ was used and a collimation aperture of $30 \times 30 \unit{mm^2}$ is set for all experiments.
    The samples are measured both at a sample-to-detector distance of $2 \unit{m}$ and at $8 \unit{m}$ with a collimation distance of $5.3 \unit{m}$ and $7.8 \unit{m}$ respectively.
    The nanoparticles are measured in a magnetic field of $515 \unit{mT}$, which is applied perpendicular to the beam direction, in the horizontal direction.
    Each sample is measured over a time of $20 \unit{min}$ at the long sample-to-detector distance and $10 \unit{min}$ at the short sample-to-detector distance.
    The empty beam and a sample of toluene-\textit{d8} is additionally measured for background subtraction.
    For evaluation of the magnetic scattering, a $20^\circ$ sector around the vertical dimension is azimuthally integrated by using the GRASP software.
    Furthermore, the polarization efficiency of $97 \%$ and a flipping efficiency of $99 \%$ of D33, according to the instrument specifications given by the local contact, is corrected with the GRASP software during data reduction.

    From the distances and aperture sizes, an angular divergence of $2.1 \unit{mrad}$ and $3.8 \unit{mrad}$ are calculated for the long and short detector distance respectively by \refeq{eq:methods:sans:formulaResolution}.
    These values overestimate the actual angular resolution of the instrument, as to why the parameters are set to $1.7 \unit{mrad}$ and $2.8 \unit{mrad}$, which are fitted values of the angular divergence parameters obtained from nanocubes measured under the same conditions in \refch{ch:colloidalCrystals}.

    To evaluate the SAS data, a spherical form factor of an iron oxide nanoparticle in an inverse spinell phase is used.
    The scattering length density of particle is calculated by
    \begin{align}
      \rho &\eq   8 \frac{(3-\delta) b_\mathrm{Fe} + 4 b_\mathrm{O}}{a_\mathrm{inv.\,spinell}^3},
    \end{align}
    where $b$ is for neutron scattering the nuclear coherent scattering length and for X-ray scattering $b \eq r_e f$, with $r_e$ the classical electron radius and the  atomic form factor $f$.
    The values are found for the elements of the periodic table in literature \cite{Sears_1992_Neutr, BerkeleyLab_1993_asf} and are tabulated in \refapp{appendix:slds}.
    The lattice constant is estimated from the values obtained in XRD for IOS-11.
    The parameter $\delta$ determines whether the phase is closer to magnetite ($\delta \eq 0$) or maghemite ($\delta \eq \tfrac{1}{3}$).
    The choice of $\delta$ is also discussed in the evaluation of the XRD data.
    The SLD of the surfactant oleic acid and the solvent scattering length densities are fixed to the values calculated from literature and tabulated in \refapp{appendix:slds}.

    In the minimization procedure of both SAXS and SANS models, a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm\cite{Marquardt_1963_Analgo, Oliphant_2006_Guide} is applied for which a modified $\chi^2$ on the logarithmic scale is used
    \begin{align}
      \chi^2 \eq \frac{1}{N-p} \sum_{i\eq 1}^{N} \frac{(\log(I_i) - \log(I_\mathrm{model}))^2}{\sigma_i^2} I^2_i.
    \end{align}

    Furthermore, as the particle size and size distribution is very well determined by SAXS, which has a larger dynamic range in scattering vector, these parameters are not varied for the SANS form factor, where vice-versa the surfactant thickness is only determined by SANS and then fixed in the SAXS form factor.
    This is done until both calculated form factors are self-consistent with each other.

    The particle number density $n$ obtained as parameter from SAS, is transformed to a mass concentration of the particles by
    \begin{align}
      c_m \eq n \rho V_p,
    \end{align}
    where $V_p$ is the volume of the particle and $\rho$ the mass density of the nanoparticle.

    For the magnetic form factor in SANSPOL, the geometrical parameters are fixed from the nuclear form factor of SANS and only the magnetic scattering length density profile of the nanoparticles is varied.

  \paragraphNewLine{Vibrating Sample Magnetometry}
    To confirm the results obtained by polarized small-angle neutron scattering and furthermore to study the temperature-dependent magnetization of the nanoparticles, vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) is applied to measure the macroscopic magnetization of a dispersion.
    Using the same dispersions as in SANS samples, $21 \unit{\musf L}$ of IOS-11 and $24 \unit{\musf L}$ of IOS-7 in toluene-$\mathit{d8}$ are sealed in vials using a hydrogen burner.
    The vials are measured on a PPMS Evercool II (\refsec{ch:instruments:laboratoryInstruments:vsm}) at $300 \unit{K}$ in a range of $\pm 9 \unit{T}$ and at a low temperature of $30 \unit{K}$ in a range of $\pm 2 \unit{T}$ after zero-field and field cooling within a strong field of $1 \unit{T}$.
    The toluene-\textit{d8} background is estimated by measuring a vial with $37 \unit{\musf L}$ of the pure solvent, from which a diamagnetic susceptibility of $-0.300 \unit{memu/T}$ is observed.
    That susceptibility, rescaled to the relative volume difference with the sample is subtracted from the measurements to discuss only the nanoparticle magnetization.

    From the magnetization data at room temperature, the magnetic moment of the single nanospheres is determined by fitting a Langevin curve with excess susceptibility, which is then used together with the size determined by SAXS to scale the data to the magnetic volume as described in \refsec{ch:methods:vsm}.
    A second Langevin function is linearly added for a better description of the magnetization data at intermediate magnetic field strengths between $2 - 4 \unit{T}$, and to account for a potential second phase in the nanoparticles, meaning that the fitted magnetization behaviour is described by
    \begin{align}
      M(H) \eq M_{s, \, 1} \mathcal{L} (\mu_{1} \mu_0 H) + M_{s, \, 2} \mathcal{L} (\mu_{2} \mu_0 H) + \chi \mu_0 H,
    \end{align}
    with $\mathcal{L}(x)$ the Langevin function.
    Furthermore, for both samples the temperature dependent magnetization is measured by cooling the sample down to $10 \unit{K}$ once with a field of $10 \unit{mT}$ and once at zero field.
    From the low temperature the sample is heated with $1.5 \unit{K \, min^{-1}}$, while measuring the magnetization.
    To adjust for an expansion of the vibration rod, the sample centers every $10 \unit{min}$ by performing a touchdown with the sample rod.
