  A quick and effective way to transfer nanoparticles from a dispersion to a thin layer on a substrate is spin coating.
  Here a droplet of a dispersion with a high concentration of nanoparticles is transferred on a substrate, which subsequently rotates the substrate with a high angular frequency.
  Due to the centrifugal force, most parts of the dispersion is removed from the substrate and only a homogeneous thin layer remains on the substrate.
  The thickness of the thin nanoparticle layer can be tuned by variation of the rotation speed, the nanoparticle concentration in dispersion, and the time that the substrate is rotated.
  On the one hand spin coating produces quickly and effectively thin layers with homogeneous thickness, but on the other hand it is highly inefficient in material usage, as most parts are lost during the process.
  As will be shown in the following, the quick process also has the downside that the nanoparticles generally do not have enough time to self assemble in highly ordered structures.

  Thin layer samples of the previously discussed nanoparticles were prepared by the same collaboration that produced the nanoparticles.
  As substrate, silicon wafers were chosen and pretreated for 30 minutes in a fresh Piranha solution (\ch{H2SO4} [conc.] and \ch{H2O2} [30\%] in a ratio of 2:1). Subsequently they washed with \ch{EtOH} and heated in an oven to $450 ^\circ \mathrm{C}$ for one hour.
  After that procedures any organic remain is removed from the silicon and the nanoparticle dispersion is spin coated on the substrate.
