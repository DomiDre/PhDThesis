  In summary, the physical sizes determined from small-angle scattering are self-consistent with the other performed experiments and are fixed in the following discussion of self-assembled nanostructures from these nanoparticles.
  The magnetization obtained for the single iron oxide nanoparticles is estimated in the order of $\approx 175 \unit{kAm^{-1}}$.
