  For the magnetic properties of the loosely packed nanospheres, vibrating sample magnetometry provides a method to study the macroscopic magnetization of SC-IOS-11 and SC-IOS-7.
  The field-dependent magnetization of both samples at room temperature is shown in \reffig{fig:looselyPackedNP:layer:vsm}.
  In both cases a superparamagnetic behaviour is observed with no excess susceptibility.
  The magnetization are well described by a Langevin curve with the parameters given in \reftab{tab:looselyPackedNP:layer:vsm}.

  The determined magnetic moment from the Langevin curve is in both cases in a similar order of magnitude as the primary magnetic moment obtained for the samples measured in dispersion in \refsec{sec:looselyPackedNS:nanoparticle:vsm} with deviations only in the order of $5 \%$.
  % For SC-IOS-11 it is possible that the nanospheres on the silicon substrate have oxidated partially in comparison to the nanospheres in dispersion and therefore a higher magnetization per particle is achieved, and for SC-IOS-7 the obtained value is still in agreement with the result from SANSPOL for IOS-7 (\refsec{sec:looselyPackedNS:nanoparticle:sas}).

  \end{figure}

  Furthermore, temperature-dependent magnetization measurements of the spin-coated layers are shown in \reffig{fig:looselyPackedNP:layer:vsmZFCFC}.
  The blocking temperature of SC-IOS-11 is determined from the ZFCw measurement to $102(1) \unit{K}$ and for SC-IOS-7 to $47(1) \unit{K}$.
  For SC-IOS-7 the value is well in agreement with the blocking temperature measured for the nanospheres IOS-7 in dispersion (\refsec{sec:looselyPackedNS:nanoparticle:vsm}).
  But for SC-IOS-11 the value is significantly increased in comparison to a blocking temperature of $95.5(5) \unit{K}$ obtained for IOS-11.

  As both macroscopic magnetization measurements of the nanoparticle dispersion and the spin-coated layer have been performed multiple years after the synthesis, it can be assumed that the nanospheres are in both cases in a fully oxidized state as observed in the nanoparticle characterization.
  The increased blocking temperature of SC-IOS-11 indicates thus a dipolar coupling between the spheres.
  This effect is commonly observed in literature when the temperature-dependent magnetization of non-interacting particles is compared to particles at high concentration \cite{Morup_2010_Magne, Pauly_2012_Sized, Otero_2000_Influ}.

  In a next step, polarized neutron reflectometry is used to study the nanostructure magnetization with depth-resolution.
  For the discussion of the reflectivity curves measured at low temperatures, the analogue measurements have been performed on the VSM in \reffig{fig:looselyPackedNP:layer:vsm30K}.
  Both samples have been zero-field cooled and field cooled, before a hysteresis up to a field of $730 \unit{mT}$ is measured at $30 \unit{K}$.
  In both cases a small hysteresis with a coercive field below $20 \unit{mT}$ is visible and the field cooled hysteresis is shifted with respect to the zero-field curve.
  As mentioned in the nanoparticle characterization (\refsec{sec:looselyPackedNS:nanoparticle:vsm}), this shift is also typically observed for the non-interacting magnetite nanoparticles from the oleate synthesis and comes from an exchange-bias effect that originates either from the initial core-shell structure of the nanospheres or after oxidation from the anti-phase boundaries \cite{Wetterskog_2013_Anoma}.




  % At low temperatures the magnetization of IOS-11 and IOS-7 in \reffig{fig:looselyPackedNP:nanoparticle:vsm10} show a hysteretic behaviour, where IOS-11 has a coercive field of $40 \unit{mT}$ and IOS-7 a field of $25 \unit{mT}$.
  % The temperature dependent curves furthermore show the blocking temperature of IOS-11 to be at $100 \unit{K}$ and for IOS-7 at $45 \unit{K}$.
  % The smaller values observed for IOS-7 is connected to the larger population of small-sized nanoparticles, which even at low temperatures are more susceptible to thermal fluctuations.
