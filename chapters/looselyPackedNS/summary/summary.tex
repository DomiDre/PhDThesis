\begin{document}
  In this first chapter, two batches of iron oxide nanospheres, as well as spin-coated layers and bilayer stacks of said nanospheres are characterized structurally and magnetically.
  Seeing that the nanospheres themselves have magnetic properties that deviate strongly from the bulk properties expected from any common iron oxide phase, such as magnetite, maghemite or w\"ustite, the first step is crucial.
  Without it is impossible evaluate whether magnetic properties observed in packed nanostructures are a result of the interparticle interaction or a result of the nanoparticle properties themselves.

  For the batch of larger nanospheres, IOS-11, a core-shell structure of w\"ustite-magnetite is observed by complimentary small-angle scattering and X-ray diffraction experiments, which have their results confirmed by electron microscopy and vibrating sample magnetometry.
