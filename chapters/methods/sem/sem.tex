  \section{Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)}
    \label{ch:methods:sem}
    To get a qualitative image of the local surface structure of a nanostructure, as well as the cross-sectional structure, scanning electron microscopy is a general method to resolve structures larger than $5 \unit{nm}$.
    Here, an electron beam scans step wise over an area of interest and detectors placed inside the chamber of the microscope measure the intensity of secondary electrons created by the interaction of the primary electrons with the atoms of the sample.
    Multiple processes can...
