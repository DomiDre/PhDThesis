  For the synthesis of iron oxide nanocubes, the synthesis route from iron oleate is chosen.
  In a first step iron oleate is prepared, which is subsequently used in a heating-up synthesis with the aim to obtain homogeneously shaped nanocubes with a small size distribution and strong magnetic properties.
  In the following, the synthesis steps for the oleate preparation and the heating-up synthesis are described.

  \paragraphNewLine{Preparation of Iron Oleate \cite{Hyeon_2003_Chemi, Wetterskog_2014_Preci}}
    A clear solution of sodium oleate is prepared by dissolving $72 \unit{mmol}$ ($2880 \unit{mg}$) of \ch{NaOH} in $20 \unit{mL}$ of each \ch{H2O} and \ch{EtOH} and subsequently adding drop wise $72 \unit{mmol}$ ($25.25 \unit{mL}$) of oleic acid.
    Subsequently $24 \unit{mmol}$ ($6480 \unit{mg}$) of \ch{FeCl3 * 6 H2O} are dissolved in $5 \unit{mL}$ \ch{H2O} and $15 \unit{mL}$ \ch{EtOH} and added to the solution.
    After addition of $80 \unit{mL}$ \ch{H2O} and \ch{EtOH} each, as well as $160 \unit{mL}$ n-hexane, the mixture is held at reflux ($60 \unit{^\circ C}$) for $4 \unit{h}$ under constant strong magnetic stirring.
    After that the mixture is cooled to room temperature, and washed three times in a separatory funnel with $30 \unit{mL}$ \ch{H2O} each.
    Using a rotary evaporator, the remaining n-hexane, ethanol and water is removed.

    $10 \unit{mmol}$ ($9036 \unit{mg}$) of the iron oleate is dissolved in $50 \unit{mL}$ 1-octadecene in a $250 \unit{mL}$ three-neck round-bottom flask.
    Sodium oleate is prepared separately by solving $2.5 \unit{mmol}$ ($100 \unit{mg}$) \ch{NaOH} in $1 \unit{mL}$ of \ch{H2O} and \ch{EtOH}, and adding $2.5 \unit{mmol}$ ($1.127 \unit{mL}$) of oleic acid drop wise.
    The sodium oleate is added to the solution with the oleate and additional $2.5 \unit{mmol}$ ($1.127 \unit{mL}$) oleic acid are added.
    The mixture is heated and held at $120 \unit{^\circ C}$ for one hour under constant magnetic stirring until no water/ethanol condenses on the three-neck round bottom flask.
    A fractionating column is put on the round-bottom flask and nitrogen is gently bubbled into the mixture.
    Using a temperature controller, the mixture is heated to reflux at approximately $315 \unit{^\circ C}$ with a gradient of $2.5 \unit{^\circ C min^{-1}}$, where it is held for $30 \unit{min}$.
    After cooling the reaction naturally to room temperature, the particles are precipitated with \ch{EtOAc} and \ch{EtOH}, centrifuged at $8000 \unit{rpm}$ and redispersed in n-hexane until the supernatant is clear.
    The final product is dispersed in n-hexane and stored as highly concentrated dispersion of $37 \unit{mg \, mL^{-1}}$.
    This synthesis yields approximately $500 \unit{mg}$ nanocubes and is referred to as Ol-Fe-C.
