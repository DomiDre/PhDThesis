  To achieve a long-ranged order three dimensional colloidal crystal, silicon substrates are vertically positioned in a slowly drying dispersion of the nanocubes Ol-Fe-C.
  For this purpose, the silicon substrates are first cleaned by washing them with ethyl acetate and isopropanol (HPLC grade) using a ultra-sonification bath for ten minutes each.
  The silicon substrate is fixed on a custom built Teflon platform and placed in a small beaker.
  Then $3 \unit{mL}$ of a toluene dispersion of nanocubes with a concentration of $c_m$ are filled in the beaker, which is tightly enclosed by aluminium foil.
  A single hole is punctuated in the center of the aluminium foil with a hypodermic needle of $0.9 \unit{mm}$ diameter to allow a slow evaporation of the dispersion.
  The beakers, shown in \reffig{fig:colloidalCrystals:preparation:image} are placed in a fume hood of a low-vibration room and allowed to evaporate without interference over a course of $1 - 2 \unit{weeks}$ until the solvent and the wafer surface has completely dried.
